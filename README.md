# Task-2_Lab-10

Simple C++ console program that models a hospital admitting patients and prints admission messages.

## Prerequisites
- Modern C++17-capable compiler (e.g., GCC 9+, Clang 10+, or MSVC 2019+).
- Standard shell (quote the filename as shown to handle the `#`)

## Build
The filename contains `#`; keep the quotes in the command so shells treat it correctly.
```bash
mkdir -p output
g++ "Task#2.cpp" -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -o "output/Task#2"
```
Debug build example (adds symbols):
```bash
g++ "Task#2.cpp" -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -g -o "output/Task#2"
```
Release build example (optimized):
```bash
g++ "Task#2.cpp" -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -O2 -o "output/Task#2"
```
Adjust the `-std` flag if your compiler defaults to a newer standard or if you prefer compiling as C++11. Add `-Werror` if you want warnings treated as errors. The code only relies on standard library basics and is compatible with both C++11 and later standards.

## Run
From the repository root:
```bash
"./output/Task#2"
```

### Expected output
```
Hospital admits Alice, age 30
Hospital admits Bob, age 45
```

## Repository contents
- `Task#2.cpp`: Source code for the hospital admission example.
- `output/Task#2`: Binary generated by the build command (regenerate on your machine as needed).
